"""Readability ratchet + per-file advisory for lifted C (readable-lift Phase 3).

Tracks the readability debt the readable-lift initiative pays down, so that
recovery wins are locked in (baseline can only ratchet DOWN) and new lifts get
per-file feedback on how "un-recovered" they still read.

Categories:
  raw_fnptr_cast   ((T(*)(A))0xADDR)(...)   HARD -- bypasses kb.json/thunks and
                                             hides calling-convention bugs. A raw
                                             cast is NEVER necessary (add the
                                             callee to kb.json instead), so this
                                             stays hard-gated -- but by the
                                             long-standing tools/audit/check_raw_casts.py
                                             (baseline tools/raw_cast_baseline.txt).
                                             Reported here for the --changed-only
                                             view only; not owned by this baseline.
  fun_call         FUN_<addr>(...)          SOFT -- a call to (or definition of)
                                             an un-named function. Legitimately
                                             grows as new code is lifted, so it is
                                             tracked and ratcheted-down, never
                                             hard-blocked.
  raw_offset_deref *(T *)(ident + 0xNN)     SOFT -- an un-recovered struct field
                                             access. Same rationale as fun_call.
  untyped_producer *(T *)(p + 0xNN) where p HARD -- p came from an untyped cast
                   came from `(char *)f(...)`      of a call, so the struct type was
                                                   lost at f's kb.json RETURN decl,
                                                   not at this line. Typing that one
                                                   decl types every caller at once
                                                   and is codegen-neutral (a pointer
                                                   return is EAX either way). Gated
                                                   on ADDED lines only, so existing
                                                   sites never block an edit.

Modes:
  --check           Global ratchet over src/. Auto-lowers the soft baseline on any
                    decrease (locks the win). WARNS if a soft category grew but
                    exits 0 (non-blocking) -- normal lifts add FUN_ calls and
                    offset derefs before recovery pays them down. Raw fn-ptr casts
                    are NOT gated here; run check_raw_casts.py for that hard gate.
  --untyped-producer
                    Repo-wide census ranking producers by the offset-deref debt
                    downstream of their untyped return. The kb.json worklist,
                    ordered by leverage. Read-only.
  --untyped-producer-added
                    Report only sites on lines ADDED by the staged diff.
                    Exits 1 if any -- this is the pre-commit hard gate.
  --self-test       Unit-check the scope walker.
  --changed-only    Per-file, line-numbered findings across ALL categories for the
                    files you have touched (git staged + unstaged-tracked +
                    untracked). Developer/agent feedback loop. Exits 1 if any
                    findings so they are noticed before committing.
  --update          Rewrite the soft baseline to the current counts.
  --report-by-object
                    Aggregate the per-file findings per kb.json OBJECT (the
                    translation unit a recovery campaign is scoped to) and print
                    a debt table sorted by total findings. Read-only; touches no
                    baseline. `--json [path]` writes/prints the machine-readable
                    form (consumed by tools/recovery/recovery_frontier.py).
  --json            Machine-readable output.
