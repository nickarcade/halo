"""Propose CEA names for unnamed NTSC (FUN_) functions by call-graph neighborhood.

This does not compare source text. It anchors on functions we already trust
on both sides -- "seeds", NTSC addresses whose current kb.json name is also
a CEA corpus function name, either because the two names were always
identical or because a rename_mapping.json row already applied that name --
and asks, for each unnamed FUN_, which unmatched CEA function shares the
most seed-named neighbors with it in the call graph.

Design notes (see the step-3b scoping note this implements):

* Object hard filter. cea_corpus/index.json's per-function "file" field
  turns out to be exactly "blam/" + name + ".c" for all 7,318 functions
  (verified empirically; also documented in cea_corpus_index.py's own
  docstring: "blam/ one function per .c file"). It carries zero grouping
  information beyond the function's own name, so a literal "CEA file maps
  to this kb object" lookup built from seeds could never match a
  not-yet-matched candidate's file (a file that, by definition, has never
  been observed as a seed). Instead this script builds the grouping from
  each CEA function's addr360: linked objects are laid out contiguously in
  the Xbox 360 binary, so sorting seeds by addr360 and looking at which kb
  object each seed's neighbors fall into is a genuine, empirically-checked
  many-to-one CEA-address-range -> NTSC-object mapping. A quick check
  (see docs; not shipped as code) found 88% of addr360-adjacent seed pairs
  share a kb object, and the 12% that disagree cluster tightly at real
  object-transition boundaries -- exactly what you would expect from a
  contiguous per-object layout, not from scattered noise. A candidate is
  placed in kb object O's window only when both its addr360 neighbors
  (the nearest seed below and above it) agree on O, or when it sits at the
  very edge of the seeded range and has only one neighbor. Disagreements
  are left unplaced (windowed pools only, never used as a hard filter by
  themselves). CEA functions with addr360 == null (~1,043, mostly the
  "_0".."_22" inline-duplicate families) can never be windowed and so only
  ever compete for kb objects that currently have zero seeds (see below).

* When a kb object has zero seeds, there is nothing to window against, so
  every not-yet-matched CEA function (windowed or not) is a legal
  candidate for every FUN_ in that object, per the design note's "or to no
  object yet if the object has no seeds" clause. Scoring precision +
  margin carries the load here, not the object filter.

* Anchored containment, not Jaccard. CEA callee lists include inlined and
  macro calls that the NTSC binary only partly emits as direct E8 calls,
  so raw-set Jaccard over full callee lists is not comparable across the
  two sides. Instead: of the NTSC target's callees (and, symmetrically,
  callers) that are themselves seeds, what fraction of their CEA names
  show up in the candidate's own callee (or inverted-caller) list. Anchors
  a candidate does not touch at all are cheap to enumerate: candidate X is
  reachable as a callee-side anchor hit for seed S exactly when S is in
  cea_callers[S']-style inversion, i.e. X in cea_callers[S] (X calls S);
  and reachable as a caller-side anchor hit for seed S exactly when
  S in cea_callees[X] (S is called by X), i.e. X in cea_callees[S]. So the
  full candidate set worth scoring for a target is the union, over the
  target's seed-callees and seed-callers, of cea_callers[seed] and
  cea_callees[seed] -- no need to score the whole corpus per target.
