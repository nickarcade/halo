"""Unicorn-Engine differential tester for pure x86 functions.

Compares MSVC-compiled delinked .obj (oracle) against clang-compiled lifted
.obj (candidate) by running both in separate Unicorn x86 emulators with
identical inputs and comparing CPU+FPU state at RET.

QUICK START
-----------
    # Basic smoke test (leaf function, 100 seeds):
    python3 tools/equivalence/unicorn_diff.py <func_name>

    # Non-leaf function (has external calls like csmemcpy, fabs):
    python3 tools/equivalence/unicorn_diff.py <func_name> --allow-stubs

    # FPU-heavy function with float output buffers:
    python3 tools/equivalence/unicorn_diff.py <func_name> --allow-stubs --float-tolerance 32

    # Detailed per-seed state dump:
    python3 tools/equivalence/unicorn_diff.py <func_name> --allow-stubs --verbose

    # Run self-test against built-in leaf function:
    python3 tools/equivalence/unicorn_diff.py --self-test

FLAGS
-----
    --seeds N          Number of test vectors (default: 100).
    --seed N           Base RNG seed for reproducibility (default: 0).
    --allow-stubs      Enable non-leaf emulation.  Patches DIR32 data
                       relocations, redirects REL32 calls to stub sentinels,
                       and emulates known callees (csmemcpy, fabs, _chkstk,
                       etc.) inline.  Required for any function that calls
                       other functions or references global data.
    --float-tolerance N
                       ULP (Unit in the Last Place) tolerance for float*
                       scratch buffer comparison.  When set, float pointer
                       params are compared element-by-element allowing up to
                       N ULP difference per float.  Non-float slots remain
                       byte-exact.  Auto-detects float* params from the
                       function declaration.  Typical values:
                         16  — tight, catches real bugs (recommended default)
                         32  — moderate, tolerates 1-2 extra rounding steps
                        256  — loose, for functions with long FPU chains
                       1024  — very loose, for extreme count=128 degenerates
    --float-params NAMES
                       Comma-separated param names to treat as float arrays.
                       Only needed when auto-detection guesses wrong.
    --verbose          Print per-seed register dump, FPU state, stub trace,
                       and scratch buffer diff for failures.
    --output-json PATH Write structured JSON result for CI/automation.
    --batch-classify   Classify every function in
                       tools/verify/function_bounds.json against the pristine
                       XBE as leaf / data_only / stubbable / non_leaf, into
                       leaf_cache.json.
    --list-funcs OBJ   List function symbols in a .obj file.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Locates the oracle (delinked/*.obj from the original XBE) and the lifted
   candidate (build/*.obj compiled from our C sources).
2. Parses the function declaration from kb.json to determine parameter types,
   calling convention, and return type.
3. Generates typed test seeds: corner-case values for scalars, float arrays
   for pointer params, sanitized for valid-path execution.
4. For each seed, runs both oracle and lifted in separate Unicorn x86 (i386)
   instances with identical memory layout:
     - Stack (1 MB), code, and a globals region for DIR32 targets seeded from
       known XBE data
     - Scratch buffer for pointer params (1 KB per param)
     - Stub sentinels for intercepted calls
   Every base address lives in `memmap.py` -- do not restate them here; the
   ones this docstring used to name were already stale.
5. Compares EAX/EDX (integer return), ST0 (float return), and scratch buffer.
   With --float-tolerance, float* scratch slots use ULP comparison instead of
   byte-exact.

GLOBALS SEEDING
---------------
The oracle COFF has DIR32 relocations like DAT_002533c8 that reference XBE
data addresses.  These are patched into the GLOBALS region (see memmap.py).
_KNOWN_GLOBAL_BYTES maps original XBE addresses to their canonical values
(0x2533c0=0.0f, 0x2533c8=1.0f, etc.).  After patching, _build_globals_seeds
writes the correct values into the GLOBALS slots so the oracle reads the same
data as the real binary.  The lifted code accesses these addresses directly
(via *(float*)0x2533c0 in C) and gets correct values from auto-mapped pages.

STUB EMULATION
--------------
External calls are redirected to sentinel addresses.  Known stubs:
  - _chkstk: stack probe, no-op in Unicorn (stack is pre-allocated)
  - csmemcpy / memcpy: reads src, writes dst, returns dst
  - fabs: x87 FABS instruction on ST0
  - _display_assert / system_exit: no-op (return 0)
All other stubs return 0/EAX or 0.0/ST0 depending on ABI.

INTERPRETING RESULTS
--------------------
  "4 passed, 0 failed"           — Oracle and lifted are equivalent for
                                   these seeds.  Genuine equivalence is
                                   likely (especially with --seeds 100+).
  "14 passed, 6 failed"          — Look at the failure details.  If the
                                   diff is in float scratch and ULP < 32,
                                   use --float-tolerance.  If EDX or EAX
                                   differs, there's a real logic bug.
  "0 passed, N failed, M errors"  — Errors mean the emulator crashed
                                   (unhandled stub, unmapped memory, stack
                                   overflow).  Check --verbose output for
                                   the crash address and missing stubs.

# 1e-4 epsilon double; the capture holds its low dword `000000e0`, and seeding
# four bytes leaves the high dword zero, so the oracle compares against
# 4.6e-310 instead of 1e-4 and takes the other branch
# (reference_equiv_oracle_reloc_gap).  The image holds all eight bytes,
# `000000e0 e2361a3f`, and always did.

# So this is not a second opinion -- it is the same opinion without the width
# limit.  6183 of the file's 7181 entries are file-backed and every one of them
# already agrees with the image byte for byte.  The remaining 998 (no section,

    ``defined_symbols``), leaving the encoded field at its raw addend (usually
    0), so the jump reads a garbage/zero target and control escapes into
    unmapped memory.  Clang instead parks its tables in .rdata, which the
    rdata_map/_relocate_rdata_text_refs path already handles.

    ``FunctionSlice.text_symbol_offsets``) and patch the field to the address
    the code is loaded at: ``CODE_BASE + (offset - base_delta) + addend``.
    ``base_delta`` is 0 when the full .text section is mapped at CODE_BASE
    (a label at section offset V lands at CODE_BASE+V) and the function's
    ``section_offset`` when only the extracted slice is mapped at CODE_BASE
    (matching ``_relocate_rdata_text_refs``).

            would execute 6.5 MB of real Halo code until MAX_INSN -- so
            `hook_code` gets an EIP-domain guard (H5);
          * `global_reads` is recorded against auto-mapped pages only, and
            image pages are pre-mapped, so the union is what gets recorded or
            concolic Phase 2 silently stops seeing any input (H6).
    entry_va: absolute VA to run from; required with `image`.
    native_callee_ranges: iterable of `(lo, hi)` VA ranges the oracle is
        DELIBERATELY allowed to execute natively, i.e. callees the candidate
        also runs for real.  Anything outside the target body, the stub
        sentinels and these ranges trips the H5 guard.
    intercept_vas: `{callee VA: sentinel}` (H9).  A 5-byte `E9 <rel32>` is
        written at each VA inside the image, so every call reaching that
        callee -- from the target body, from a sibling, direct or tail --
        lands on the same sentinel the candidate's call site was patched to.
        The patch targets the CALLEE, not the call site, because raw image
        bytes carry no relocation to rewrite: the call is a finished E8 with a
        correct displacement into real code.  Without it the oracle runs the
        engine natively while the candidate hits return-0 trampolines, which
        compares "lift" against "lift plus engine" (H9).

#     gate, suppressing oracle stub sentinels, and letting the Z3 proof run over
#     code containing CALL.  `_classify_raw_oracle` recovers the same three
#     counts by disassembling the bytes.
#   * `slice_looks_truncated` answered "does the reference actually cover the
#     function?" from `reached_section_end`, which a raw slice never sets.
#     `_oracle_bound_unreliable` answers it from the committed bounds table.

    """Consecutive dwords at `slot_va` that are exact kb.json function entries.

    A direct `E8 rel32` names its callee in the instruction, so the intercept
    set (H9) falls out of the disassembly.  An INDIRECT call names only a
    pointer, and until the pristine image was mapped that pointer held nothing:
    the delinked oracle's unrelocated word read as zero, the data-exec guard
    "recovered" with EAX=0, and the call simply never happened.  With the image
    mapped the pointer is real, the oracle makes the call for real -- and while
    the candidate still stubs its equivalent callee, that is "lift vs
    lift+entire engine" again, which is what H9 exists to prevent.

    Two shapes turn up in `game_state.obj` alone and both are resolved here:

      * a single slot -- `game_state_save` opens with
        `call dword ptr [0x32eaa0]`, whose slot holds 0x1bf760, a sibling in
        the same object.
      * a TABLE walked through a register --
        `game_state_call_after_load_procs` is
        `mov esi, 0x32eaa8; mov edi, 0xd; call dword ptr [esi]; add esi, 4;
        dec edi; jne` over 13 function pointers.  The call site names no
        address at all, so the table has to be read from the pointer the
        function loads.

    Hence "a run of dwords", not "one dword": the run is what makes the second
    shape work without inferring the loop's trip count from `edi`.  Reading
    further than the loop actually walks is harmless -- an intercepting JMP
    only matters if control reaches it -- whereas reading too few leaves a live
    callee escaping into real engine code.

    The two dword tests are deliberately NOT the same test.

    The FIRST dword must land exactly on a kb.json function entry.  That is the
    expensive claim and it is what keeps this cheap and safe on the common
    case: a plain `push <format string>` probes one dword, fails, and stops, so
    no `.rdata` byte soup is ever mistaken for a table.

    Later dwords only have to point into `.text`.  Requiring a function entry
    there truncates real tables: of the 13 pointers at 0x32eaa8, five
    (0xb9880, 0x17ca90, 0x1939e0, 0x1bfbd0, 0x877e0) are in neither kb.json
    nor `function_bounds.json` -- they are real engine functions this project
    has simply never listed -- and stopping at the first of them left nine
    callees escaping.  Inside a table whose head is a confirmed function
    pointer, a `.text` address in the next slot IS evidence of a call target;
    demanding a second, independent attestation of something we can already
    see is what produced the wrong answer.  The run still stops at the first
    dword that is not `.text` at all, which is how the 13-entry table ends
    (slot 13 holds 0).

    Over-reading is the safe direction and under-reading is not: an
    intercepting JMP only matters if control reaches it, so a spurious entry
    costs an unused sentinel, while a missing entry is a live escape into real
    engine code and a lost verdict.

                   A branch back INSIDE that range is a local label and counts
                   as nothing.
      dir32_count  absolute-address SITES inside the XBE image span: a memory
                   operand's displacement with no base register, or an
                   immediate.  Counted per site, not per distinct address,
                   because that is what `classify_relocations` does -- each
                   relocation is one site.

    Two deliberate differences from the delinked classifier, both because a raw
    image has no notion of an "object":

      * `intra_obj_calls` is always 0.  There is no exported range for a call
        to be internal to.
      * `call_count` is therefore >= the delinked `call_count` for the same
        function.  A delinked .obj that happens to CONTAIN the callee resolved
        that call itself, with a correct in-object displacement and no
        relocation at all (which is why `_has_raw_calls` /
        `_redirect_raw_calls` exist to find them), so `classify_relocations`
        structurally cannot see it.  Every such call still leaves the function
        body and still has to be intercepted symmetrically with the candidate
        (hazard H9), so counting it is the point, not an error.
        `test_raw_oracle_classify.py` pins exactly this relationship.

    Why the operand guards matter: an absolute displacement is only
    recognisable as such when the operand has no base register
    (`mov eax, [0x4ea9ac]`, or the indexed-table form
    `jmp [eax*4 + 0x1e5000]`); a displacement off a base register is a struct
    field, not a global.  `.rdata` addresses are counted like any other -- a
    delinked object names them `s_...` / `DAT_...` externals, and only a
    relocation against its OWN `.rdata` section carries the `.rdata` prefix
    that `classify_relocations` skips.

    A bare IMMEDIATE is the one genuinely ambiguous form, since a plain size or
    count can land in the image span by arithmetic accident: `cmp eax, 0x40000`
    (256 KB) and `push 0x40000` both fall inside `.text`, which starts at
    0x12000, and both were counted as data references until this rule was
    added.  So an immediate pointing into `.text` is only accepted when it is
    an exact kb.json function entry -- i.e. when it really is someone taking
    the address of a function.  Immediates into `.rdata`/`.data` keep no such
    requirement: there is no plausible reading of `push 0x2b998c` other than a
    pointer to the format string that lives there.

    Until the raw-XBE migration this iterated `delinked/*.obj` and read each
    function's relocation table.  `delinked/` is gitignored and holds ONE
    object on this tree, so the sweep covered 20 functions out of ~8000 and
    every other row in the cache was whatever an older, better-stocked
    checkout had left behind.  `function_bounds.json` plus the pristine image
    cover all of them from two committed, reviewable inputs with no Ghidra in
    the loop, and `_classify_raw_oracle` recovers by disassembly what the
    relocation table used to supply.

    Bounds that cannot found a verdict are SKIPPED, not guessed.  A `class`
    derived from a run-time-computed extent, from a `table_data` range, or
    from a `no_terminator` end that is really just the next symbol's start
    would sit in the cache looking exactly like a reviewed one -- and
    `--allow-stubs` budgets, the z3 gate and target selection all read this
    file.  `_oracle_bound_unreliable` is the same gate the live oracle uses,
    so the cache cannot claim a classification for a function the oracle
    would refuse to run.
