"""Pins the data-execution guard's recovery rule.

WHY
---
`hook_code`'s data-exec guard fires when emulation starts executing inside a
page the harness auto-mapped for DATA, which means an indirect call went
through synthetic state.  Its recovery is "EAX=0, pop the return address,
continue", which is exactly right when a CALL got there: the CPU really did
push a return address, so the top of the stack really is one, and pretending
the bogus callee returned 0 is sound and symmetric across both sides.

It is wrong when a RET got there.  A RET has already consumed the return
address, so popping again takes whatever is underneath -- typically a saved
register or the address of a local, i.e. a STACK address.  Jumping to a stack
address means decoding that address's own bytes as instructions, so whether the
run faults or stalls harmlessly is decided by the numeric value of STACK_BASE.

That is not a hypothetical.  `game_state_memory_pool_new` RETs to 0x00000000
because a sibling call's delinked relocation resolves to nothing; it scored
40/40 PASS at 60% coverage with STACK_BASE=0x00100000 and ERROR with
STACK_BASE=0x08000000, on identical code.  The verdict was a coin flip on an
address constant.

So the guard now refuses a popped target inside the stack and reports the
escape.  These tests pin that, plus the stack-address predicate it relies on.
